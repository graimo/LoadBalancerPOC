# LoadBalancerPOC
This is a PoC of a Load Balancer for SwissRe. 

There are TWO classes: Load Balancer and provider in the relative files. 
All the 8 tasks have been taken into account. The main.py file consists of a test to show that the code does what it is meant to do.

Improvements to be done: termination of processes in providers
